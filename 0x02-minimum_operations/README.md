# minimum_operations
```
Let's say we start with the text file containing a single H. We can perform two operations:

Copy All: This operation copies all the characters in the file to the clipboard.
Paste: This operation pastes the clipboard contents after the last character in the file.
Using these two operations, we need to determine the fewest number of operations required to get exactly n H characters in the file. For example, if n is 4, we need to get the file to contain "HHHH" using the copy and paste operations.

One way to approach this problem is to start with a file containing a single H and then keep copying and pasting until we reach the desired number of H characters. Each time we copy and paste, the number of H characters in the file doubles. For example:

Start with "H"
Copy All: "H"
Paste: "HH"
Copy All: "HH"
Paste: "HHHH"
...
We can stop this process once we have reached n H characters or if the number of H characters in the file is already greater than n. In the latter case, it is impossible to reach exactly n H characters in the file using these two operations.

To implement this algorithm in Python, we can keep track of the number of operations performed and the current number of H characters in the file. We can use a loop to keep copying and pasting until we reach the desired number of H characters or until we can no longer reach the target number.

The if n <= 1 condition checks if n is less than or equal to 1. If so,
it means that the desired number of H characters is already achieved, so the function
returns 0 (no operations needed).

The code enters a while loop as long as n is greater than 1. This loop performs the
calculation of the minimum number of operations.

Inside the loop, a few variables are initialized. maxm_num_oper_s is set to 0 and
module_list is an empty list. The purpose of module_list is to store the factors of n that divide n evenly.

The for loop iterates over the numbers from 1 to n-1 (exclusive). For each number i 
in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i using the condition n % i == 0. 
If it is, i is a factor of n, so it is added to the module_list.

After the for loop, the maximum value in module_list is assigned to maxm_num_oper_s 
using the max() function. This maximum factor represents the number of H characters 
that can be achieved in the fewest number of operations.

Next, ncopy_oper_s is incremented by 1, representing the copy operation. npaste_oper_s 
is incremented by ((n // maxm_num_oper_s) - 1), which represents the paste operations.
(n // maxm_num_oper_s) calculates the number of times the paste operation needs to be 
performed to achieve n H characters. Subtracting 1 accounts for the initial H character already present.

Finally, the value of maxm_num_oper_s is assigned to n, and the loop continues until n 
becomes 1.
he variables ncopy_oper_s and npaste_oper_s hold the respective counts of copy and paste 
operations needed. The code calculates their sum and assigns it to the variable sum. 
This sum represents the fewest number of operations required to achieve n H characters.

The function returns the value of sum.
```
###    Example
```
Start with a single H character:
H

To achieve 4 H characters, follow these steps:
1. Copy    All: Copy the existing H.
H
2. Paste: Paste the copied H next to the existing one.
HH
Now, we have two H characters. And we're going to repeat the steps 1 & 2.
Copy All the existing HH.
Paste the copied HH next to the existing HH.
HHHH
now we have 4 H characters as needed

copy operations = 2
paste operations = 2
total of operations = 4

therefore, n = 4: the minimum_operations needed to 
achieve 4 H (HHHH) characters is 4.
