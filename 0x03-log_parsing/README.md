# Log Parsing

```
Log parsing is the process of analyzing and extracting meaningful 
information from log files generated by various computer systems, 
software applications, or devices. These log files record events, 
actions, errors, and other relevant information that can be useful 
for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing purposes. Log parsing 
is a crucial activity for system administrators, developers, and security
professionals to understand what's happening within their systems and 
applications.

During log parsing, the tool can filter out irrelevant log entries based 
on specific criteria, such as log level, source IP address, or error codes.
 After filtering, the remaining log entries are parsed to extract the 
 desired fields or information.
